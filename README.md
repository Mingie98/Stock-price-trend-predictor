# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

## Project Overview
This project leverages a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict future stock prices based on historical price data. This deep learning model is implemented in Python with Keras and TensorFlow libraries.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalizes and sequences stock price data for better model performance.
- **LSTM Network**: Utilizes a sequential model of LSTM layers to learn from historical prices.
- **Visualization**: Plots training and testing predictions against actual stock prices.
- **Evaluation**: Calculates Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to assess model accuracy.
